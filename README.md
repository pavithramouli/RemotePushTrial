Simple Code Snippets with Comments for Enabling Push Notifications

Basic steps to enable push notifications from an iOS app is documented in this project. Most implementation contained in the AppDelegate.

1) Manages active(foreground and background) and inactive states <br>
2) Handles custom actions<br>
3) Documented<br>
4) Tested in iOS 9.2. Written in Objective-C.<br>

A blog documenting the remote notification scenarios and how to handle them is coming soon. 

Known Issue:<br>
While the text input action shows a text box, I still haven't managed to get the right delegate fire up properly. Just for this case.
